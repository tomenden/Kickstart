		<dt>The first weeks</dt>
		<dd>		
			<p>
				Beginning in the third week, a puppy's senses begin to awaken. His eyes and auditory canals open so he can communicate with his brothers and sisters for the first time.
			</p>
			<p>
				At around the 21st day he'll make his first attempts at walking and barking. Within the safety of his family circle, he'll have his first experiences and get to know the complex social behavior of his species.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the fourth week, the senses of the puppy are fully developed so that he is able to carefully observe his environment. He will examine and sniff everything. At this stage of life, his ability to learn is as great as it will ever be. So this is the stage where you should spend a lot of time with your puppy to help him grow up to be a sociable dog. However, an intense relationship with his brothers and sisters is just as important. He can begin to eat solid food from the fourth week on. We recommend PEDIGREE PUPPY® Food.
			</p>
			<p>
				Between 8 and 12 weeks, the puppy is in the socialization stage, and can move to a "human pack". The best time for the separation from mother and brothers and sisters is at 10 weeks of age.

		<dt>The first months</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				If you adopt a puppy at about the 10th week, take him to the vet immediately. He/she will check his health status and will advise you on the right timing for vaccinations and worming.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your puppy now needs a lot of loving attention to be able to cope with the new environment and the loss of his brothers and sisters. You should praise him often and say his name at the same time. Also, you should set his boundaries with a stern "no" and begin with house training.
			</p>
			<p>
				The puppy's development until the 16th week is called the "phase of hierarchy" by dog researchers. Now your dog will need a "leader of the pack".This is also true for his diet. It is your decision what and when your dog is fed and what he is not to eat. So make sure your puppy's special requirements for nutrients are met in this phase of quick growth. Give him a variety of experiences such as riding in a car, riding in a bus or on an elevator, visits to restaurants, gatherings of people, and contact with children, other dogs, and other animals. This way he'll be an agreeable, strong-minded companion as an adult dog.

		<dt>Puberty</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The phase of puberty is usually rather short and will last from between one month and six weeks. It starts around the sixth month, and can manifest itself in many different ways: often your dog will behave badly and won't want to learn anything new. Sometimes he may forget what he has learned so far, or at least pretend to. In this phase, you should be persistent and keep on with his education program.

		<dt>The adult dog</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				A male has finished puberty when he starts to lift his leg to urinate. A female will be out of puberty when she goes into heat for the first time; this may happen between the seventh and eighth month, but may take up to one year.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should not have your bitch mated or bred when she is in heat for the first time because her organs are not yet fully developed. After her first heat, her diet should be changed to that of an adult bitch You can feed her PEDIGREE® in many different types and flavors.
